## Purpose

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate a number of exploratory data visualization concepts using historical crime data from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2). Cleaned data was subsequently processed for visualization using javascript and the D3.js library. Please see the GitHub Pages for the bar chart visualization [here](location_bar.html) and the heatmap visualization [here](heatmap.html).

## Source Data

Data was retrieved from the Chicago Data Portal via API request from the JupyterLab environment. Data was pulled from the most recent complete three year period (2018 - 2020). Data was cleaned primarily using the pandas library for Python and exported in .csv format.

## Data Visualizations

## Notes

Python code used to perform data cleaning is located in the Jupyter Notebook files. Output data (.csv and javascript files) are located in the static folder.
